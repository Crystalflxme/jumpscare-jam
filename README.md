# jumpscare-jam

A 24-hour game jam project. Why "jumpscare"? Because the game jam was announced 3 hours before it started! The theme was "ocean".

This is my first Bevy project, and my second Rust project.

## Playing

You can either build the project or check it out on [Itch](https://crystalflxme.itch.io/jumpscare-jam).

## Ideas

Some ideas to further the project I had:

- Speedrun timer (instead of it being the window's title)
- Title screen, win screen
- Music and sound
- Better graphics (while keeping the salami crab)
- Longer level (maybe with checkpoints)
